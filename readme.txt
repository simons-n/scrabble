Summary of Project:

	This project is the game of Scrabble. Originally, players were meant to be able to connect to a network and paly each other from other computers. We werent able to complete this, though did put a lot of time into the networking portion, so the final program supports a 1-player Scrabble game. The game uses a Scrabble dictionary to check the validity of a played word, and the words are scored according to the tile and board values. The Scrabble board is displayed on the screen with a panel holding the values of all the tiles, the scores of all the players, the specific player's hand, and buttons to help with the functionality of the game. 

	To play the game, the user will run the class called StartBoxMain. They will be prompted to either join an existing game or start their own game. Once you click start a new game, enter your name, choose a 1 player game, and the Scrabble board will appear. The player then has the ability to place tiles on the board from their hand, shuffle the tiles in their hand, and play the word. Once the word has been played and accepted (an error message did not pop up), you can click the pass turn button and you will receive new tiles from the tile bag to replace those you placed on the board.
